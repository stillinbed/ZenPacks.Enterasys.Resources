Monitor the main hardware components (CPUs, Storage Units, Processes) of Enterasys switches which support ENTERASYS-RESOURCE-UTILIZATION-MIB. 

This zenpack provides:
- Modeling of CPUs, Storage Units and Processes
- Performance monitoring of CPU Utilization (total as well as per running process) and Storage Utilization
- Threshold crossing alarms for CPU and Storage Utilization

The following screenshot depicts component modelling and performance monitoring for the storage units of an Enterasys Matrix N7 switch in Zenoss:
